# Admin Dashboard Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic enhancement of the admin dashboard to ensure all CRUD operations work correctly with proper error handling, validation, and alignment with backend APIs.

## Current Status: Analysis Phase Complete

### Critical Issues Identified:

#### üö® **CRITICAL API Issues:**
1. **Missing DELETE endpoint for users** - `/api/users/route.ts` has no DELETE method
2. **Incorrect API calls in admin dashboard** - Using wrong HTTP methods and endpoints
3. **API endpoint mismatch** - Frontend expects query params but backend uses dynamic routes

#### üîß **Frontend Issues:**
1. **submitForm function bugs** - Incorrect API endpoint usage
2. **Missing proper error handling** - Basic alerts instead of proper feedback
3. **No form validation** - Client-side validation is minimal
4. **Poor user experience** - No loading states, confirmation dialogs

#### üìä **API Endpoints Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Platforms**: Full CRUD via `/api/platforms` (POST) and `/api/platforms/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ **Tasks**: Full CRUD via `/api/tasks` (POST) and `/api/tasks/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- ‚ùå **Users**: Missing DELETE method in `/api/users/route.ts`
- ‚ùå **Admin Dashboard**: Using incorrect API patterns
