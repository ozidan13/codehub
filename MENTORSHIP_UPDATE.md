# Mentorship System Upgrade Implementation Plan

## Overview
Upgrade the existing mentorship system to support two types of sessions:

- [x] Test face-to-face booking flow
- [x] Test admin date management
- [x] Test booking approval with date changes
- [x] Verify all error handling
- [x] Check TypeScript compilation
